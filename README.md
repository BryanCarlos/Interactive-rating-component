## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

That's the first project I did all by myself, I tried my best to don't search for anything, but I couldn't. Some examples: how to change the radio button design and how to add and remove a class from a div using "classList".

### Continued development

I really need to improve my JS skill. JS isn't a hard language, but it's the first language that I'm trying to learn deeper. So for the next project I'll work harder to do a better JS code. 

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - This helped me for design the radio button. I think it's a very usefull way to "kill" all your doubts.
- [BackeFront](https://backefront.com.br/verificar-radio-button-checado-javascript/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to know which radio button the user check.
